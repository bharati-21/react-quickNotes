## My Learnings
- One of the important learnings was understanding `lifting the state` to the nearest ancestor of components that share common state.
- How to pass references of state update functions to child components that change the state was another learning.
- Using npm packages such as `nanoid` and `react-split` was a new takeaway.

## Challenges
- The main challenge was displaying the contents of active note selected from the sidebar on the editor.
- Another challenge, was creating a dynamic textarea that changed it's height and added scrollbar depending on the contents typed onto it. I tried using eventhandler `keydown` on the textarea to set it's height as the scrollHeight property. As it did not work as expected, I used the npm package - `react-textarea-autosize`.
